How to land the Star Cruiser 42

# Context

This dataset contains information about simulations of landing a spaceship in a 2D environment.
This information can be used to determine the efficiency function in order to evaluate the best actions possible in a future landing.


# Metadata
Number of train files: 9513
Number of test files: 2000
Number of variables: 13
Target variable: efficiency


File variable details:

- x_pos # The position of the ship on the X axis, in units relative to the landing platform.
- y_pos # The position of the ship on the Y axis, in units relative to the landing platform.
- x_vel # Velocity of the ship on the X axis.
- y_vel # Velocity of the ship on the Y axis.
- angle # The angle of the spaceship in radians.
- ang_vel # The angular velocity of the spaceship.
- leg_1 # Boolean that represent whether leg 1 is in contact with the ground or not
- leg_2 # Boolean that represent whether leg 2 is in contact with the ground or not
- main_booster #  The throttle of the main engine.
- lat_booster # The throttle of the lateral boosters.

The first 6 variables determine the state and each step, and the last two (main_booster and lat_booster) are the actions taken in response
to that state, whose repercussions will be seen in the following step.

Experiment variable details:
- gravity # The magnitude of the gravity acceleration. A value of 0 means that the system didn't register the real value.
- wind_power # The maximum magnitude of linear wind applied to the spaceship. A value of 0 means that the system didn't register the real value.
- turbulences # The maximum magnitude of rotational wind applied to the spaceship.

Target variable detail
    - efficiency # An internal function of the simulator to evaluate the quality of the landing.
